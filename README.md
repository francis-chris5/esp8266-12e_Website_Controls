# esp8266-12e_Website_Controls
These are the starter files I created for IoT projects revolving around an ESP8266-12E NodeMCU DevBoard. It is still a work in progress and has only undergone rudimentary testing, these files are currently probably best used as reference material for your own projects --easier to not get lost if you do your own thing and know what every part there does, but feel free to use these and save a ton of setup time if you'd like.

If you wish to use these files it should be sufficient to upload the files to a domain hosting site, create the database, and change connectionDetails.php to reflect the names assigned by the domain host.

Formal documentation for these starter files can be found at  https://francis-chris5.github.io/esp8266-12e_Website_Controls/.

An earlier draft was used in a video covering the logic and concepts to make an IoT project come to life located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6ubdUwX80&list=PLBA4kDe4kZOpp6n_HfVZsD--R74wog6-O&index=13
